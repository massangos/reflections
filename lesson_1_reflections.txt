How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It makes me an efficient programmer because I will make changes in a big project without the fear of breaking it.
It also make my work more easy because I can explore as much as I want to, I have a history which serve as a roll back in case 
I break it. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
When you commit you must commit something that will be understandable what were you committing.
If a task is big commit after you added a specific logic,dont wait until you finish the entire task.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I think its just because some files depend on other files to function, so if they are saved separatly its not gonna be easy to compare them and view the changes
 between two commit, because you will have to compare them one by one while you can just compare more than one for with just running one command.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

To view the history file you just type 
git log enter

then you take the commit id that you want to view and the last commit id before that commit id, then you type
git diff commitid1 commitid2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It make it easy for me to find where did the break took place.
